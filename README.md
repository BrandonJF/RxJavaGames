RxJavaGames
===========

The goal is to develop 10 games in [RxJava](https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava/) and JavaFx (included in Java JDK 8).

At this moment, **5** games are finished:
* Pong
* Happer
* Tic Tac Toe
* Crazy Eights
* Flappy Bird
* [ChainRx](http://www.yvoschaap.com/chainrxn/)

We are currently working on the following games:

* Platform game / sidescroller

Further down the line we plan to do:
* JPacman (a Java port of Pacman) - refactoring of an [already existing version](https://github.com/SERG-Delft/jpacman-framework/)
* Wolfenstein
